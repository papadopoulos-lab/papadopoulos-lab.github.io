Most analyses have three (or more) main sections: code, results, and data, each with different requirements (version control/sharing/encryption). You provide folder locations and 'org' helps you take care of the details.\nauthor:\n  - name: \"Richard Aubrey White\"\n    url: https://rwhite.no\n    affiliation: Folkehelseinstituttet\n    affiliation-url: https://www.fhi.no\n    orcid: 0000-0002-6747-1726\ndate: 2022-07-21\n---\n\n\n\n\n*This blog post has also been posted [here](https://docs.sykdomspulsen.no/posts/2022-07-21-org-version-2022-7-20-published-on-cran/).*\n\n## Changes since last version\n\nThe R-package \"org\" (version 2022.7.20) has been published on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/org/index.html). \"org\" is a part of the [splverse](https://docs.sykdomspulsen.no/packages.html), a set of R packages developed to help solve problems that frequently occur when performing infectious disease surveillance. A significant breaking change is that `org::initialize_project` now takes in `env` as an argument (the environment into which the functions will be sourced). It is now recommended to include `env = .GlobalEnv` into the function call.\n\n<aside>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](org.png){width=655}\n:::\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n```\norg::initialize_project(\n  env = .GlobalEnv,\n  home = \"/git/analyses/2019/analysis3/\",\n  results = \"/dropbox/analyses_results/2019/analysis3/\"\n  raw = \"/data/analyses/2019/analysis3/\"\n)\n```\n\n## Concept \n\nThe concept behind `org` is fairly simple - most analyses have three main sections:\n\n- code\n- results\n- data\n\nYet each of these sections have extremely different requirements.\n\nCode should:\n\n- Be version controlled\n- Be publically accessible\n- Have 1 analysis pipeline that logically and sequentially details all steps of the data cleaning, analysis, and result generation\n\nResults should:\n\n- Be immediately shared with close collaborators\n- Have each set of results saved and accessible, so that you can see how your results have changed over time (i.e. \"if we run the code today, do we get similar results to yesterday?\")\n\nData should:\n\n- Be encrypted (if sensitive)\n- Not stored on the cloud (if sensitive)\n",
